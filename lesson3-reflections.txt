When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-- when I wish to share code with others and get help from them too

(test editing files on github)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-- because I wish to manage my local repo by myself, and someone (even me) could have added/changed files on github

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-- fork => a clone from github to github (create personal version of another user's project)
-- clone => a clone from github or local to local (creating a local version from a remote repository)
-- branches => one history line in development (create a different history line to add features or try different things)
