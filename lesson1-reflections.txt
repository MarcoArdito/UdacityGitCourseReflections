How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

-- it helped a lot finding only diffrences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-- it could speed up a lot comparing changes and restore old versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

-- I could forget to commit sometimes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-- it helps keep related things consistent in the commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-- git log helps identifying commits IDs, git diff show old/new commits changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

-- because I can go back to a consistent state and check all

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
